## Music Library UI Assessment 🎵

Given the albums.json, create a simple UI that can do the following
1. Display the albums as a list of UI components. Each component should render the album artwork image, title, and artist.
2. Add a sort component that allows the user to sort the albums by artist name or album name.
3. Remove albums.
4. The `alt` property for each `<img>` tag should be set to the parsed out filename from the url. For example:  "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a6/Souvlaki_%28album%29_cover.jpg" should render as `<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a6/Souvlaki_%28album%29_cover.jpg" alt="Souvlaki_%28album%29_cover.jpg" />`


A mock-up has been included to provide visual guidance. Your UI does not have to perfectly match the mock-up.

This exercise should not take more than a few hours. It's okay to get creative but don't stress yourself out!


When you are finished, either send us a forked repo, or zip your local repo (no node modules please!) and send it on over. And of course, email us if you have questions.
